# Exercises string-to-number conversion (s.toInt64(), s.toUint64(),
# s.toFp64()): the built-in, non-class dot-operations on 'string', in the
# same style as list.length/buffer.resize(). Covers success, a leading
# '+', overflow, invalid characters (including trailing garbage and an
# empty string), a negative sign rejected by toUnsigned, and a null
# receiver raising instead of crashing.
