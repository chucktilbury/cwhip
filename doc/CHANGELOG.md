# Cwhip development changelog

## Source and scope

This is an implementation history for the author of a book about Cwhip and
the process of developing it, not a release-by-release compatibility contract.
It consolidates the complete, non-shallow Git history reachable from
[`0450d9b`](https://github.com/chucktilbury/cwhip/commit/0450d9bcef1c0d16dc4c417f3c3b562741611bbb)
(`Formatted variables`, October 14, 2026), beginning with
[`a948573`](https://github.com/chucktilbury/cwhip/commit/a948573f4d7ecc726783634468370e61e67a42ba)
(`initial commit`, September 28, 2026). The previous cutoff contained **191
commits**, including branch work and merges, rather than only first-parent
history. This update covers **203 commits** through the current cutoff.

The narrative groups repeated fixes, documentation synchronization, and merge
commits into milestones. The appendix retains every original commit subject,
including spelling, and uses Git author dates in their recorded time zones.
Its oldest-first order follows `git log --reverse 0450d9b`; merges remain
separate traceability records, not additional implementations of a feature.
Historical names and syntax describe the project at the time, not necessarily
the current language. Performance results below are supplied reports from
implementation sessions, not measurements inferred from commit messages or
rerun while writing this document. The GUI milestone below is framed as a
proof of concept and compiler-testing tool, not a production IDE/debugger.

## Implemented milestones

### Unreleased: ScrolledWindow policy and snapshot guard

`Gtk.ScrolledWindow.setPolicy` exposes scrollbar policy. SourceView custom
snapshot overlays skip drawing until the view has a non-zero allocation, which
avoids racing an unallocated scrollbar GtkGizmo on first layout.

### Unreleased: Auto-indent and gutter-only marks

`setAutoIndent` exposes GtkSourceView auto-indent. `setMarkStyle` accepts an
optional `lineHighlight` flag (default true); false keeps a gutter icon only—no
gutter background tint, underline, or paragraph color. Setting a language no
longer forces auto-indent or tab defaults.
### Unreleased: Visible right-margin guide

`setRightMargin` draws the column guide in the SourceView snapshot layer so it
remains visible when the active style scheme has no right-margin color.

### Unreleased: Selected-lines typing filter

`GtkSource.View.setSelectedLinesEdit` applies printable typing, Backspace, and
Delete at the selection-start column across a multi-line selection (not true
multi-carets).

### Unreleased: SourceView edit primitives for editors

`GtkSource.View` gains a right-margin guide, selection edge queries, undoable
`insertText` / `deleteRange` / `replaceRange` / `selectRange` with
`beginUserAction` / `endUserAction`, and `Gtk.Clipboard.setText` / `text()`
(same-process cache; GDK clipboard reads stay asynchronous).

### Unreleased: Toolbar buttons activate on press

Non-focusable buttons (`setCanFocus(false)`, as used by debugger toolbars) run
their `onClicked` handler on mouse press instead of release, so a dropped
button-release cannot swallow the first click. SourceView line-selection no
longer claims the capture click sequence for the same reason.

### Unreleased: Button focus-on-click and toolbar focus

`Gtk.Button` is created with `focus-on-click` disabled so the first mouse press
activates the button instead of only focusing it (important when focus was in a
text/source view). `Widget.setFocusOnClick` / `setCanFocus` expose the same
controls for toolbars that must leave editor focus alone.

### Unreleased: Window F10 / menubar accelerator

`Window.bindShortcut("F10", …)` clears GTK's default menubar F10 accelerator
so the bound action runs on the first keypress. `setMenubarAccel(bool)` /
`menubarAccel()` expose the same `GtkWindow` property explicitly.

### Unreleased: Notebook tab scroll arrows

`Notebook.setScrollable` resets click gestures on the notebook and its arrow
children after page changes, page add/remove, and notebook resize, and rewires
arrow `clicked` handlers when overflow arrows are recreated. Without that, a
lost button-release (often when focus moves into the new page) or a resize that
hides and shows the arrows left them claiming clicks and doing nothing until
another tab was selected.

### Unreleased: Debug builds emit Cwhip DWARF

`cwhip_add_program` passes `-g` when `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is `Debug` or
`RelWithDebInfo`, so application binaries include line info for `.cw` sources.
Previously only linked C libraries had DWARF, so cdbg opened runtime/GTK C
files and not the program source.

### Unreleased: Editor UI GTK helpers

`MenuBar.addSubmenu` / `clearMenu` rebuild nested menus. `Button.setIconName`,
`Widget.addCssClass`, and `setTooltip` match flat tab-close styling.
`setShowWhitespace` draws spaces/tabs/NBSPs; `setShowLineEnds` draws newlines.

### Unreleased: Paned sidebar sizing

`Paned` no longer lets the start child shrink past its minimum, and the end
child may shrink so the start side can grow. `Widget.setWidthRequest` sets a
nonnegative width floor for that minimum.

### Unreleased: Context menus that keep the native popup

`GtkSource.View.addContextAction` appends a row to the built-in text-view
menu. `ContextMenu` is a `PopoverMenu` with `addItem` / `addCheckItem` so
sidebar menus look like ordinary menus instead of a box of buttons.

### Unreleased: Source mark tooltips and whitespace drawer

`setShowWhitespace` enables GtkSourceView's space-drawer matrix so spaces and
tabs actually appear. Source marks can carry hover text through
`addLineMarkTooltip`, underline the marked line, and tint its background.
Mouseover of the gutter mark or the line shows that text.

### Unreleased: Error recovery and the language server

A source error no longer ends the check. The parser resumes at the next
statement or declaration, and semantic analysis continues with the next
statement, method, and class. `cwhip` prints every recovered error under one
`CWHIP1001` header, up to 100, and still skips code generation when any error
was reported. `cwhip-lsp` is a separate executable that links that frontend
and speaks a small Language Server Protocol session on stdin: initialize,
full-document open/change/save/close, and `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`.

### Unreleased: Source view markers and check menus

`GtkSource.View.setShowWhitespace` draws every space, tab, newline, and
non-breaking space. `setShowIndentMarkers` draws a vertical guide at each
tab-width step of leading indentation. `Gtk.MenuBar.addCheckItem` adds a
checkbox whose callback receives the new state; `setItemChecked` updates it
without that callback. `Widget.visible` reports the current visibility.

### Unreleased: Regular sequence operations

Lists, buffers, and strings share indexing, inclusive range copies, `insert`,
and inclusive `remove`. Lists and dicts also have `clear()`. A string index
reads a `uint8` and may replace one ASCII byte. `byteAt`, half-open `slice`,
and `removeRange` are removed. A nonempty `slice(first, last)` is
`text[first..last - 1]`. List `append` and `insert` accept buffers and handles.

### Unreleased: String storage

A `String` keeps its bytes in one array freed with the string, instead of a
second collected `buffer`. `cwhip_string_new` copies the source into that
array before allocating the object. `replace`, case conversion, and a string
range slice hand that array over without copying it again. `buffer(n)` is
unchanged and still zero-fills. Existing programs need to be recompiled so
the string object matches this layout.

### Unreleased: String bytes across collection

`cwhip_string_new` copies its source bytes before allocating, so a collection
in that call cannot invalidate a pointer into a live string buffer. `split`
snapshots both strings before it allocates the result list. Catch-all
bindings borrow the exception frame's message until that frame is cleared.

### Unreleased: Standalone GUI applications

The bundled editor/debugger sources, build targets and application-specific
tests have been removed. [cedit](https://github.com/chucktilbury/cedit) and
[cdbg](https://github.com/chucktilbury/cdbg) now build in their own repositories
against the installed SDK. The GTK/SourceView packages, language definition
and compiler-owned headless binding coverage remain here. GUI descriptions
below are historical, not instructions for building the current checkout.
`Application.ready()` and its launcher readiness pipe have been removed.

### Unreleased: Fixed-width numeric SDK (0.0.2)

The `numeric-v2` SDK migrates bundled source APIs to exact numeric types while
preserving 64-bit public counts/indices. String parsers name every destination
width and reject textual range loss. Packages require an explicit SDK ABI
declaration, object sidecars are versioned, and generated entry points require
the new runtime ABI symbol. The installed GUI-capable SDK is exercised with
external CMake/native consumers and headless SourceView numeric APIs.
See [NUMERIC-MIGRATION.md](NUMERIC-MIGRATION.md) for source replacements,
compatibility limits, and an isolated build recipe.

### Unreleased: Dedicated SDK configuration

Install registration now writes `cwhip/sdk.toml` instead of app preferences
in `cwhip/settings.toml`, so preference rewrites cannot erase the registration.
`cwhip-pkg doctor` honors the dedicated file, falling back to the legacy key only
when it is absent, without migrating or rewriting either file. A present invalid
SDK configuration fails explicitly; a non-empty `CWHIP_SDK` still bypasses parsing.
XDG/HOME selection, staged-install skip, and registration opt-out are unchanged.

### Unreleased: Package doctor and project creation

`cwhip-pkg doctor` checks the selected SDK and host tools without modifying
files or using the network, reports actionable per-check remedies, and treats
GUI development dependencies as optional. SDK settings follow the shared
`CWHIP_SDK`/XDG/HOME precedence. `cwhip-pkg new NAME [DIRECTORY]` downloads
the public project template as an archive, supports ref selection and offline
directory/tar/ZIP sources, validates and stages extraction, renames project
and executable references, and omits Git history without initializing Git.
New failure boundaries are registered in [DIAGNOSTICS.md](DIAGNOSTICS.md);
offline regression coverage includes extraction safety and doctor side effects.

### Unreleased: Incremental compiler and package diagnostics

Compiler CLI/source reporter and `cwhip-pkg` error boundaries now use tool-local
diagnostic codes under the shared [diagnostic contract](DIAGNOSTICS.md).
Source-location lines remain compatible with existing consumers; backend and
Git failures retain their details instead of becoming success-shaped summaries.
Headers are plain text, backend color is disabled for redirected output or
`NO_COLOR`, and compiler-selection fallback is visible. The installed contract
records the code registry, application allocations, exit behavior, and remaining
legacy boundaries. Offline CLI, source reporter, and install checks cover this
incremental adoption.

### Unreleased: MIT license

The repository now includes the standard MIT license, with copyright
attribution to Charles Tilbury for 2026.

### Unreleased: Relocatable application output directories

The installed CMake SDK helper now accepts explicit executable and GtkSourceView
resource output directories while preserving the existing `bin` and `share`
defaults. Its package config exposes `Cwhip_APPLICATION_OUTPUT_DIRECTORIES` so
consumers can reject older 0.0.1 SDK installs before using the new arguments.
The SDK documentation describes cache-overridable application `bin`/`lib`
locations and keeping GUI language resources beside the selected executable.

### September 28: A compiler foundation and an object model

The initial commit already established the lexer, parser, AST, semantic
analyzer, code generator, command-line driver, CMake build, and tests. Minimal
code generation then developed alongside multiple inheritance, inheritance
visibility, and class visibility. The project was still called **Simple**.

Two commits removed semicolon syntax. Runtime work introduced garbage-collected
destructors and began exception handling, including bound exception messages.
Virtual bases and their constructor arguments arrived before the end of the
day. These were early foundations that later constructor, destructor, and
virtual-base fixes continued to refine.

### September 29: Collections, modular source, and runtime interoperability

Collections first appeared under the names **arrays** and **maps**. Namespaces,
`import`, `include`, and `inline` expanded source organization and native
integration. Follow-up work corrected function-definition scope, runtime shims,
and return syntax, separated the runtime shims, and reorganized functional
tests.

Inline support and scalar types were followed by buffer and handle types,
null values, explicit casts, and runtime thread support.

### September 30: Overloads, exceptions, strings, and package foundations

Method and constructor overloads, resizable arrays with append, exception
classes, and exception stack traces broadened the language. The `is` and `type`
operators, slice shorthand, and reference identity added ways to inspect and
manipulate values.

Basic string support grew into a completed String class. Package design and
implementation began, with module location/settings, Clang configuration, and
optional debug information. Tests were unpacked and adjusted as behavior
changed; the String merge records integration rather than a second feature.

### October 1: System libraries and a rapidly settling language

A system-level interface, implemented and tested standard libraries, build
environment scripts, grammar, and language reference made the project more
usable outside the compiler itself. Repeated documentation and merge commits
tracked the evolving implementation.

Language changes disambiguated the string keyword, added string escapes,
widened `int` to 64 bits, and introduced hexadecimal integer literals.
The declaration keywords `map` and `array` were removed, and the earlier
"array" terminology was corrected to **list**.

Base-constructor syntax was revised, including dot-base construction. Scalar
compound assignments and assignment fixes, named string replacements, returns
from anywhere in a method, and corrected method-call examples continued the
language cleanup.

### October 2-3: Construction semantics and package management

Start-block fixes, direct destructor declarations and corrected destructor
syntax, implicit base-member access, and diagnostics for improper constructor
syntax addressed object-lifecycle rough edges. Constructor exceptions became
catchable. Module version selection and a package manager followed on October 3.

### October 4-5: Conversions, formatting, and practical workflows

Standard-library APIs for inline code were followed by scalar casts and
same-width scalar conversion fixes. Buffer literals, checked object casts,
object-cast corrections, casting all data types from `any`, and integer enums
expanded the value model.

Formatting moved from string-literal format calls to `format` and formatted
print. On October 5, `print` stopped adding an implicit newline. Examples and
the scanner example were updated, compiled binaries were removed, package
workflows improved, and subsequent fixes repaired integration/test failures.

### October 6: Reliability infrastructure and application-building APIs

C++-style virtual-base initialization and package-search fixes were accompanied
by hermetic multi-input tests and a shared directory. A concentrated testing
effort added sanitizer builds and fixed empty-native-string undefined behavior;
compiled and ran repository examples with checked expectations; executed
complete documentation programs and checked their output; and ran hermetic
default and sanitizer suites in GitHub Actions.

LLVM source coverage and combined HTML reports, frontend fuzzing, and parser
and AST depth-exhaustion diagnostics extended the reliability tooling.
SQLite and SQL packages arrived with follow-up test fixes. Typed method
callbacks, GTK foundations and widget interfaces, and an asynchronous process
API supplied the building blocks for GUI applications.

### October 7-8: The editor becomes a real application

The editor's first cut was developed under the name **Tweed**. Menus and
dialogs, bug fixes, a find dialog, font changes, a preferences dialog, and a
project window followed. Build procedure and build-target integration were
improved alongside the application.

October 8 brought project implementation and persistence, a name-collision
test, and GTK warning fixes. The warning history includes an initial fix,
its merge, a revert, and a replacement fix; it should not be read as an
uninterrupted series of independent improvements.

### October 9: Simple becomes Cwhip

The project was renamed from **Simple** to **Cwhip**. Follow-up commits purged
old-name references from documentation and the wider tree, while another
commit repaired an editor test.

### October 10-11: Publishing the documentation on the web

Website work added web assets and prepared the site for live use. Path
corrections, Markdown and preview rendering, CSS/JavaScript cache-version
updates, repeated document additions, and link handling made the documentation
publishable and navigable. The same history includes a password-length change
and a discussion-form fix.

October 11 cleared out the old website and temporarily committed the Doxygen
tree for inspection. Cleanup of generated website files and a superfluous
directory continued on October 12.

### October 12: IDE refinement and language/runtime corrections

IDE progress, test fixes, editor performance optimization, and usability
enhancements refined the editor and its GTK/project-explorer support.
Separate language/runtime fixes repaired constructor arguments through aliased
imports and made file-open failures raise exceptions.

### October 13: Typing performance, shorter tests, and two GC improvements

Editor/GTK performance work improved typing behavior, and long editor tests
were split. Two successive garbage-collector changes then addressed different
performance problems:

1. **Startup-oriented GC fix:** `02f4e0e`, integrated by `58c60b5`, used AVL
   lookup for exact and interior pointers and an adaptive allocation budget of
   `max(256, previous live count)`. `CWHIP_GC_STRESS=1` enabled stress collection.
2. **Subsequent throughput work:** `f81a155` introduced hash-based exact lookup,
   object/metadata coallocation, a lazily built sorted interior-pointer index,
   bulk sweep, metadata caching, Release root-push optimization, and conditional
   finalizer remarking.

**Reported implementation-session measurements (not rerun for this history):**

| Change and workload | Reported method | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First GC fix: editor Release readiness | Median of 3 runs under `xvfb-run`/D-Bus with isolated HOME/config | 1.716 s | 0.164 s |
| Subsequent GC work: Release throughput benchmark | Medians from 7 interleaved runs per version | 1.435220 s | 0.496908 s (2.89x speedup) |
| Subsequent GC work: benchmark instruction count | Callgrind | 8.9067 billion | 3.0442 billion |
| Subsequent GC work: separate editor readiness check | Medians of 7 runs | 151.6 ms | 140.9 ms |

The subsequent work also reported **396/396 tests passing**, **15/15 targeted
stress tests passing**, and sanitizer checks in normal and stress modes.
These are historical validation reports, not a new validation of this checkout.
Startup readiness, benchmark throughput, and instruction counts are distinct
workloads/metrics: their gains must not be conflated or multiplied.

### October 13-14: GUI proof of concept and compiler-debugging workflow

The editor was renamed from `cwhip-editor` to **cedit**, while retaining its
existing settings, project/workspace data, application ID, and launcher
handshake so the rename does not move or rewrite user data.

A separate **cdbg** application became a working local GDB/MI2 prototype. It
can launch a native executable or compile a Cwhip source file with `cwhip -g`,
restart the loaded target, and open source files in distinct tabs. Find Next
and Find Previous, menus, and parented dialogs support source navigation and
debugger setup. Breakpoint menu actions set/clear and enable/disable
breakpoints; resolved breakpoints have source gutter markers, and per-project
`.cdbg.toml` state preserves them. Setup configures arguments and an optional
temporary break-at-start breakpoint. The inferior's stdout/stderr is collected
through a local PTY and kept apart from the GDB/compiler console, with Program
Output clear/copy controls. Breakpoints, watches, stack display, single-click
frame selection, and source/locals navigation provide a practical
compiler-debugging loop.

Two stepping problems had different causes and fixes. Compiler-generated
dispatch thunks could leave GDB without useful function bounds at method
returns; the compiler change removes no-op thunks and tail-transfers
receiver-adjustment thunks. Separately, a UI step press could be lost while
post-stop locals/stack/watch refreshes were in flight; the debugger now discards
stale refresh work and issues one execution command per accepted step.

The final change in this history adds friendly locals and watch summaries plus
a separate Runtime Values view that preserves GDB types and raw values. The
embedded value inspector requires Python-enabled GDB with `gdb.MICommand`.
Scalar and string values and list/dict/buffer summaries are bounded; unknown
runtime tags remain explicit, while classes show type, field count, and address
but not members because the compiler currently emits forward declarations
rather than member DWARF.

These GUI tools are a proof of concept and a way to test the compiler, not a
finished production IDE or debugger. The debugger supports local GDB only:
there is no attach, remote debugging, LLDB, or DAP support, and its output PTY
does not provide interactive inferior stdin or terminal emulation. Gutter-click
breakpoint toggling and richer class-member inspection remain future work.
